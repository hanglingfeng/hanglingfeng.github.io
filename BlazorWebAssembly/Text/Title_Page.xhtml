    <h1 id="_idParaDest-1" class="mainHeading">Foreword</h1>
    <p class="normal">Hi, friends! I love a good second edition. It’s an opportunity to update and add to something that’s already great. You take feedback from the readers and the community, absorb the zeitgeist, and turn an A into an A+. Toi has taken <strong class="keyWord">Blazor WebAssembly By Example</strong> to the next level and now we welcome you all, readers old and new.</p>
    <p class="normal">I have known Toi Wright for more than 17 years. I first met her at the Microsoft MVP Summit in Redmond back in 2005, if you can believe that. She is a brilliant technologist, community leader, and tech organizer, and we see each other every year at the annual Microsoft MVP Summit. I’ve had the opportunity to travel from my home in Portland to beautiful Dallas to speak in person at the Dallas ASP.NET User Group where she’s the president and founder.</p>
    <p class="normal">Toi has been very active in the ASP.NET community for many years. She brings energy and expertise to everything she does. She has written courseware for Microsoft on ASP.NET and this is her third book on the topic. She’s a respected programmer, architect, and communicator. </p>
    <p class="normal">In this book, she walks you step by step through the creation of 11 standalone projects that are built using the Blazor WebAssembly framework. You’ll learn how to leverage your experience with the .NET ecosystem to complete many different types of projects. Blazor takes .NET – and your .NET skills – to the web in a new way, and this book is the key.</p>
    <p class="normal">The second edition adds small updates everywhere, but also includes new chapters on debugging, deploying to Azure, and using tech like Azure Active Directory to secure a Blazor WebAssembly app.</p>
    <p class="normal">In <strong class="keyWord">Blazor WebAssembly By Example</strong>, Toi shares her extensive knowledge and years of experience as a web developer and has created an easy-to-follow guide for you to quickly learn how to use the Blazor WebAssembly framework. Through her words, step-by-step instructions, copious screenshots, and code samples, you will get started running C# in your browser instead of JavaScript. Everything she’ll show you, including .NET and Blazor itself, is all open source and based on open standards! I’m so glad that we both have a partner in Toi Wright to guide us in this powerful new web framework!</p>

    <h1 id="_idParaDest-4" class="heading-1">About the reviewers</h1>
    <p class="normal"><span class="FM-authorNameInBio">Michele Aponte</span> has been a passionate programmer since 1993, and has worked as a Java, .NET, and JavaScript programmer for several Italian software houses and IT consultancy firms. In 2013, he founded the IT company Blexin, which helps its customers to migrate their old solutions to new technologies, offering them training, consulting, and development.</p>
    <p class="normal">In 2020 he founded Ellycode to combine two great passions of his life, artificial intelligence and user experience, which led to the creation of a dashboarding and data visualization platform: Elly. Last but not least, his passion for teaching prompted Michele to found Improove; a startup that will redefine the concept of teaching online courses.</p>
    <p class="normal">He has always believed in the value of sharing, which is why, in December 2008, he founded DotNetCampania, a Microsoft community for which he has organized many free regional conferences. Microsoft awarded him the MVP award for these activities. In 2020, he brought his passion to Blazor Developer Italiani, the Italian community on the Blazor framework, of which he is the founder and community manager. His love for digital pushed him, again in 2020, to join Fare Digitale, an association that promotes the enhancement of digital culture in Italy.</p>
    <p class="normal">Michele also speaks at the most important Italian and international conferences on Microsoft and JavaScript technologies. He has written several technical books and defines himself as a community addict.</p>
    <p class="normal"><span class="FM-authorNameInBio">Vincent Baaij</span> has been working as a developer/consultant/architect in the IT industry for over 25 years and is still learning new things every day. His focus has always been on the Microsoft and .NET stack. Since 1999, he has worked primarily with content management systems like Umbraco and Episerver (now Optimizely). The open-source tools he created when he was an Episerver employee are ranked among the most popular community-contributed packages.</p>
    <p class="normal">At present, Vincent works as a Cloud Solution Architect at Microsoft where he helps customers to be successful on the Azure platform. He is also the maintainer of the official Microsoft Fluent UI Web Components for Blazor library, an open-source component package that wraps the Fluent UI Web Components for use with .NET 6.0 or higher Blazor applications.</p>
