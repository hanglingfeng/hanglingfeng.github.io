<h1><span class="label">Chapter 5. </span>.NET Overview</h1>
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary=".NET" data-primary-sortas="NET" data-secondary="overview" data-type="indexterm" id="ch05.html100"/>Almost all of the capabilities of the .NET 8 runtime are exposed via a vast set of managed types. These types are organized into hierarchical namespaces and packaged into a set of assemblies.</p>
<p>Some of the .NET types are used directly by the CLR and are essential for <span class="keep-together">the managed hosting environment</span>. These types reside in an assembly called <span class="keep-together"><em>System.Private.CoreLib.dll</em></span> (<em>mscorlib.dll</em> in .NET Framework) and include C#’s built-in types as well as the basic collection classes, and types for stream processing, serialization, reflection, threading, and native interoperability.</p>
<p>At a level above this are additional types that “flesh out” the CLR-level functionality, providing features such as XML, JSON, networking, and Language-Integrated Query. These comprise the Base Class Library (BCL). Sitting above this are <em>application layers</em>, which provide APIs for developing particular kinds of applications such as web or rich client.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we provide the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An overview of the BCL (which we cover in the rest of the book)</p></li>
<li><p>A high-level summary of the application layers</p></li>
</ul>
<aside class="pagebreak-before" data-type="sidebar" epub:type="sidebar"><div class="sidebar" id="whatapostrophes_new_in_dotnet_seven_and">
<h1 class="less_space">What’s New in .NET 7 and .NET 8</h1>
<p>The Base Class Libraries in .NET 7 and .NET 8 include numerous new features and performance improvements. In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Tar archive format, popular on Unix systems, is now supported via types in the new <code>System.Formats.Tar</code> namespace (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch15.html#working_with_tar_files">“Working with Tar Files”</a>). The <code>ZipFile</code> class has also been enhanced to allow folders of files to be zipped directly into or from a stream.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>Stream</code> class now exposes <code>ReadExactly</code> and <code>ReadAtLeast</code> methods to simplify reading from streams (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch15.html#reading_and_writing">“Reading and Writing”</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>There’s now support for working with Unix file permissions (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch15.html#unix_file_security">“Unix file security”</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Support for <code>Span&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>ReadOnlySpan&lt;T&gt;</code> has been extended. In particular, numeric and other simple types now support UTF-8 formatting and parsing directly into <code>Span&lt;byte&gt;</code> via new <code>IUtf8SpanFormattable</code> and <code>IUtf8SpanParsable&lt;TSelf&gt;</code> interfaces, and the <code>MemoryExtensions</code> class contains additional extension methods to help with searching for values within spans (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch23.html#searching_in_spans">“Searching in Spans”</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>Random</code> class now includes a <code>GetItems</code> method to pick random items from a collection, and a <code>Shuffle</code> method to randomly shuffle items (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch06.html#random">“Random”</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>.NET’s date and time types now expose <code>Microsecond</code> and <code>Nanosecond</code> properties.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>JsonNode</code> class has a number of new methods, including <code>GetValueKind</code>, <code>DeepEquals</code>, <code>DeepClone,</code> and <code>ReplaceWith</code> (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#jsonnode">“JsonNode”</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>There are two new read-only collection types, <code>FrozenDictionary&lt;K,V&gt;</code> and <span class="keep-together"><code>FrozenSet&lt;T&gt;</code></span>. These are like the existing <code>ImmutableDictionary&lt;K,V&gt;</code> and <code>ImmutableHashSet&lt;T&gt;</code> types but are optimized purely for reading, without methods for nondestructive mutation (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch07.html#frozen_collections">“Frozen Collections”</a>).</p></li>
<li><p><code>RegEx</code> now supports <code>RegexOptions.NonBacktracking</code> to help avoid denial-of-service attacks with user-supplied expressions (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch25.html#regexoptions">“RegexOptions”</a>). The regular expressions engine is also now faster.</p></li>
<li><p>Types for SHA-3 hashing are now available, subject to operating system support (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch20.html#hash_algorithms_in_dotnet">“Hash Algorithms in .NET”</a>).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The JSON serialization engine has also been improved, with new features and better performance.</p>

Valid values include <code>net8.0</code>, <code>net7.0</code>, <code>net6.0</code>, <code>net5.0</code> (for .NET versions 8, 7, 6, and 5), <code>netcoreapp3.1</code> (for .NET Core 3.1), <code>net48</code> (for .NET Framework 4.8), and <code>netstandard2.0</code> (which we cover in the following section). For example, this is how you target .NET 8:</p>
<pre data-type="programlisting">  &lt;PropertyGroup&gt;
    &lt;TargetFramework&gt;<strong>net8.0</strong>&lt;/TargetFramework&gt;
  &lt;PropertyGroup&gt;</pre>
<p>You can target multiple runtimes by instead specifying a <code>&lt;TargetFrameworks&gt;</code> element (plural). Each TFM is separated by a semicolon:</p>
<pre data-type="programlisting">    &lt;TargetFramework<strong>s</strong>&gt;<strong>net8.0;net48</strong>&lt;/TargetFramework<strong>s</strong>&gt;</pre>
<p>When you multitarget, the compiler generates a separate output assembly for each target.</p>
<p>The runtime target is encoded into the output assembly via the <code>TargetFramework</code> attribute. An assembly can run on a newer (but not older) runtime than its target.</p>
</div></section>
<section data-pdf-bookmark=".NET Standard" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="dotnet_standard">
<h1>.NET Standard</h1>
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary=".NET Standard" data-primary-sortas="NET Standard" data-type="indexterm" id="ch05.html101"/>The wealth of public libraries that are available on NuGet wouldn’t be as valuable if they supported only .NET 8. When writing a library, you’ll often want to support a variety of platforms and runtime versions. To achieve that goal without creating a separate build for each runtime (multitargeting), you must target the lowest common denominator. This is relatively easy if you wish to support only .NET 8’s direct predecessors: for example, if your project targets .NET 6 (<code>net6.0</code>), your library will run on .NET 6, .NET 7, and .NET 8.</p>
<p>The situation becomes messier if you also want to support .NET Framework (or legacy runtimes such as Xamarin). The reason is that each of these runtimes has a CLR and BCL with overlapping features—no one runtime is a pure subset of the others.</p>
<p><em>.NET Standard</em> solves this problem by defining artificial subsets that work across an entire range of runtimes. By targeting .NET Standard, you can easily write libraries with extensive reach.</p>
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
<p>.NET Standard is not a runtime; it’s merely a specification describing a minimum baseline of functionality (types and members) that guarantees compatibility with a certain set of runtimes. The concept is similar to C# interfaces: .NET Standard is like an interface that concrete types (runtimes) can implement.</p>
</div>
<section data-pdf-bookmark=".NET Standard 2.0" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="dotnet_standard_twodotzero">
<h2>.NET Standard 2.0</h2>
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary=".NET Standard" data-primary-sortas="NET Standard" data-secondary=".NET Standard 2.0" data-secondary-sortas="NET Standard 2.0" data-type="indexterm" id="id2656"/>The most useful version is <em>.NET Standard 2.0</em>. A library that targets .NET Standard 2.0 instead of a specific runtime will run without modification on both modern .NET (.NET 8/7/6/5, down to .NET Core 2) and .NET Framework (4.6.1+). It also supports the legacy UWP (from 10.0.16299+) and Mono 5.4+ (the CLR/BCL used by older versions of Xamarin).</p>
<p>To target .NET Standard 2.0, add the following to your <em>.csproj</em> file:</p>
<pre data-type="programlisting">  &lt;PropertyGroup&gt;
    &lt;TargetFramework&gt;netstandard2.0&lt;/TargetFramework&gt;
  &lt;PropertyGroup&gt;</pre>
<p>Most of the APIs described in this book are supported by .NET Standard 2.0 (and of those that are not, most are available as NuGet packages).</p>
</div></section>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Other .NET Standards" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="other_dotnet_standards">

<ul>
<li><p>.NET Core 3+</p></li>
<li><p>Mono 6.4+</p></li>
</ul>
<p>.NET Standard 2.1 is not supported by any version of .NET Framework, making it much less useful than .NET Standard 2.0.</p>
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary=".NET Standard" data-primary-sortas="NET Standard" data-secondary="older .NET Standards" data-type="indexterm" id="id2658"/>There are also older .NET Standards such as 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and 1.6, whose compatibility extends to archaic runtimes such as .NET Core 1.0 or .NET Framework 4.5. The 1.x standards lack thousands of APIs that are present in 2.0 (including much of what we describe in this book) and are effectively defunct.</p>

To help mitigate this situation, .NET 5+ and <span class="keep-together">.NET Core</span> projects are permitted to reference .NET Framework assemblies, with the following provisos:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An exception is thrown should the .NET Framework assembly call an API that’s unsupported.</p></li>
<li><p>Nontrivial dependencies might (and often do) fail to resolve.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, it’s most likely to work in simple cases, such as an assembly that wraps an unmanaged DLL.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch05.html101" data-type="indexterm" id="id2660"/></p>

This is called a <em>reference assembly</em> because it exists only for the benefit of the compiler and contains no compiled code. At runtime, the “real” assemblies are identified through assembly redirection attributes (the choice of assemblies will depend on which runtime and platform the assembly eventually runs on).</p>
<p>Interestingly, a similar thing happens when you target .NET 8. Your project implicitly references a set of reference assemblies whose types mirror what’s in the runtime assemblies for the chosen .NET version. This helps with versioning and cross-platform compatibility, and also allows you to target a different .NET version than what is installed on your machine.</p>
</div></section>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Runtime and C# Language Versions" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="runtime_and_chash_language_versions">
<h1>Runtime and C# Language Versions</h1>
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary=".NET Standard" data-primary-sortas="NET Standard" data-secondary="C# language versions and" data-type="indexterm" id="id2663"/>By default, your project’s runtime target determines which C# language version is used:</p>
<table class="border">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Runtime target</th>
<th>C# version</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>.NET 8</td>

<td>C# 7.3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>.NET Standard 2.0</td>
<td>C# 7.3</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This is because later versions of C# include features that rely on types that were introduced in later runtimes.</p>
<p>You can override the language version in your project file with the <code>&lt;LangVersion&gt;</code> element. Using an older runtime (such as .NET Framework) with a later language version (such as C# 12) means that the language features that rely on newer .NET types will not work (although in some cases, you can define those types yourself, or import them from a NuGet package).</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="System Types" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="system_types">
<h2>System Types</h2>
<p>The most fundamental types live directly in the <code>System</code> namespace. These include C#’s built-in types; the <code>Exception</code> base class; the <code>Enum</code>, <code>Array</code>, and <code>Delegate</code> base classes; and <code>Nullable</code>, <code>Type</code>, <code>DateTime</code>, <code>TimeSpan</code>, and <code>Guid</code>. The <code>System</code> namespace also includes types for performing mathematical functions (<code>Math</code>), generating random numbers (<code>Random</code>), and converting between various types (<code>Convert</code> and <code>BitConverter</code>).</p>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch06.html#dotnet_fundamentals">Chapter 6</a> describes these types as well as the interfaces that define standard protocols used across .NET for such tasks as formatting (<code>IFormattable</code>) and order comparison (<code>IComparable</code>).</p>
<p>The <code>System</code> namespace also defines the <code>IDisposable</code> interface and the <code>GC</code> class for interacting with the garbage collector, which we cover in <a data-type="xref" href="ch12.html#disposal_and_garbage_collection">Chapter 12</a>.</p>
</div></section>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Text Processing" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="text_processing">
<h2>Text Processing</h2>
<p>The <code>System.Text</code> namespace contains the <code>StringBuilder</code> class (the editable or <em>mutable</em> cousin of <code>string</code>) and the types for working with text encodings, such as UTF-8 (<code>Encoding</code> and its subtypes). We cover this in <a data-type="xref" href="ch06.html#dotnet_fundamentals">Chapter 6</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>System.Text.RegularExpressions</code> namespace contains types that perform advanced pattern-based search-and-replace operations; we describe these in <a data-type="xref" href="ch25.html#regular_expressions-id00102">Chapter 25</a>.</p>
</div></section>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Collections" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="collections-id00004">
<h2>Collections</h2>
<p>.NET offers a variety of classes for managing collections of items. These include both list- and dictionary-based structures; they work in conjunction with a set of standard interfaces that unify their common characteristics. All collection types are defined in the following namespaces, covered in <a data-type="xref" href="ch07.html#collections-id00055">Chapter 7</a>:</p>
<pre data-type="programlisting">System.Collections              // Nongeneric collections
System.Collections.Generic      // Generic collections
System.Collections.Frozen       // High-performance read-only collections
System.Collections.Immutable    // General-purpose read-only collections
System.Collections.Specialized  // Strongly typed collections
System.Collections.ObjectModel  // Bases for your own collections
System.Collections.Concurrent   // Thread-safe collection (<a data-type="xref" href="ch22.html#parallel_programming-id00071">Chapter 22</a>)</pre>
</div></section>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Querying" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="querying">
<h2>Querying</h2>
<p>Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) allows you to perform type-safe queries over local and remote collections (e.g., SQL Server tables) and is described in Chapters <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch08.html#linq_queries">8</a>, <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch09.html#linq_operators">9</a>, and <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch10.html#linq_to_xml">10</a>. A big advantage of LINQ is that it presents a consistent querying API across a variety of domains. The essential types reside in the following namespaces:</p>
<pre data-type="programlisting">System.Linq                  // LINQ to Objects and PLINQ
System.Linq.Expressions      // For building expressions manually
System.Xml.Linq              // LINQ to XML</pre>
</div></section>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="XML and JSON" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="xml_and_json">
<h2>XML and JSON</h2>
<p>XML and JSON are widely supported in .NET. <a data-type="xref" href="ch10.html#linq_to_xml">Chapter 10</a> focuses entirely on LINQ to XML—a lightweight XML Document Object Model (DOM) that can be constructed and queried through LINQ. <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#other_xml_and_json_technologies">Chapter 11</a> covers the performant low-level XML reader/writer classes, XML schemas and stylesheets, and types for working with JSON:</p>
<pre data-type="programlisting">System.Xml                // XmlReader, XmlWriter
System.Xml.Linq           // The LINQ to XML DOM
System.Xml.Schema         // Support for XSD
System.Xml.Serialization  // Declarative XML serialization for .NET types
System.Xml.XPath          // XPath query language
System.Xml.Xsl            // Stylesheet support

System.Text.Json          // JSON reader/writer and DOM
System.Text.Json.Nodes    // JsonNode API (DOM)</pre>
<p>In the online supplement at <a href="http://www.albahari.com/nutshell"><em>http://www.albahari.com/nutshell</em></a>, we cover the JSON serializer.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Diagnostics" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="diagnostics">
<h2>Diagnostics</h2>
<p>In <a data-type="xref" href="ch13.html#diagnostic">Chapter 13</a>, we cover logging and assertion and describe how to interact with other processes, write to the Windows event log, and handle performance monitoring. The types for this are defined in and under <code>System.Diagnostics</code>.</p>
</div></section>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Concurrency and Asynchrony" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="concurrency_and_asynchrony">
<h2>Concurrency and Asynchrony</h2>
<p>Many modern applications need to deal with more than one thing happening at a time. Since C# 5.0, this has become easier through asynchronous functions and high-level constructs such as tasks and task combinators. <a data-type="xref" href="ch14.html#concurrency_and_asynchron">Chapter 14</a> explains all of this in detail, after starting with the basics of multithreading. Types for working with threads and asynchronous operations are in the <code>System.Threading</code> and <code>System.Threading.Tasks</code> namespaces.</p>
</div></section>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Streams and Input/Output" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="streams_and_inputsolidusoutput">
<h2>Streams and Input/Output</h2>
<p>.NET provides a stream-based model for low-level input/output (I/O). Streams are typically used to read and write directly to files and network connections, and can be chained or wrapped in decorator streams to add compression or encryption functionality. <a data-type="xref" href="ch15.html#streams_and_isoliduso">Chapter 15</a> describes the stream architecture as well as the specific support for working with files and directories, compression, pipes, and memory-mapped files. The <code>Stream</code> and I/O types are defined in and under the <code>System.IO</code> namespace.</p>

<section class="pagebreak-before" data-pdf-bookmark="Networking" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="networking">
<h2 class="less_space">Networking</h2>
<p>You can directly access most standard network protocols such as HTTP, TCP/IP, and SMTP via the types in <code>System.Net</code>. In <a data-type="xref" href="ch16.html#networking-id00041">Chapter 16</a>, we demonstrate how to communicate using each of these protocols, starting with simple tasks such as downloading from a web page and finishing with using TCP/IP directly to retrieve POP3 email.

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Assemblies, Reflection, and Attributes" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="assembliescomma_reflectioncomma_and_att">
<h2>Assemblies, Reflection, and Attributes</h2>
<p>The assemblies into which C# programs compile comprise executable instructions (stored as IL) and metadata, which describes the program’s types, members, and attributes. Through reflection, you can inspect this metadata at runtime and do such things as dynamically invoke methods. With <code>Reflection.Emit</code>, you can construct new code on the fly.</p>
<p>In <a data-type="xref" href="ch17.html#assemblies">Chapter 17</a>, we describe the makeup of assemblies and how to dynamically load and isolate them. In <a data-type="xref" href="ch18.html#reflection_and_metadata">Chapter 18</a>, we cover reflection and attributes—describing how to inspect metadata, dynamically invoke functions, write custom attributes, emit new types, and parse raw IL. The types for using reflection and working with assemblies reside in the following namespaces:</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Native and COM Interoperability" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="native_and_com_interoperability">
<h2>Native and COM Interoperability</h2>
<p>You can interoperate with both native and Component Object Model (COM) code. Native interoperability allows you to call functions in unmanaged DLLs, register callbacks, map data structures, and interoperate with native data types. COM interoperability allows you to call COM types (on Windows machines) and expose .NET types to COM. The types that support these functions are in <code>System.Runtime.InteropServices</code>, and we cover them in <a data-type="xref" href="ch24.html#native_and_com_interoperabilit">Chapter 24</a>.</p>

<h2>Serialization</h2>
<p>.NET providers several systems for saving and restoring objects to a binary or text representation. Such systems can be used for communication as well as saving and restoring objects to a file. In the online supplement at <a href="http://www.albahari.com/nutshell"><em>http://www.albahari.com/nutshell</em></a>, we cover all four serialization engines: the binary serializer, the (newly updated) JSON serializer, the XML serializer, and the data contract serializer.</p>

<h2>The Roslyn Compiler</h2>
<p>The C# compiler itself is written in C#—the project is called “Roslyn,” and the libraries are available as NuGet packages. With these libraries, you can utilize the compiler’s functionality in many ways besides compiling source code to an assembly, such as writing code analysis and refactoring tools. We cover Roslyn in the online supplement, at <a href="http://www.albahari.com/nutshell"><em>http://www.albahari.com/nutshell</em></a>.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch05.html102" data-type="indexterm" id="id2664"/></p>

<h1>Application Layers</h1>
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary=".NET Framework" data-primary-sortas="NET Framework" data-secondary="application layers" data-type="indexterm" id="ch05.html103"/>User interface (UI)–based applications can be divided into two categories: <em>thin client</em>, which amounts to a website, and <em>rich client</em>, which is a program the end user must download and install on a computer or mobile device.</p>
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="thin-client applications" data-type="indexterm" id="id2665"/>For writing thin-client applications in C#, there’s ASP.NET Core, which runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS. ASP.NET Core is also designed for writing web APIs.</p>
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="rich-client applications" data-secondary="application layers" data-type="indexterm" id="id2666"/>For rich-client applications, there is a choice of APIs:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Windows Desktop layer includes the popular WPF and Windows Forms APIs, and runs on Windows 7/8/10/11 desktop.</p></li>
<li><p>WinUI 3 (Windows App SDK) is a successor to UWP that runs (only) on Windows 10+ desktop.</p></li>
<li><p>UWP lets you write Windows Store apps that run on Windows 10+ desktop and devices such as Xbox or HoloLens.</p></li>
<li><p>MAUI (formerly Xamarin) runs on iOS and Android mobile devices. MAUI also allows for cross-platform desktop applications that target macOS (via Catalyst) and Windows (via Windows App SDK).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are also third-party cross-platform UI libraries such as Avalonia. Unlike MAUI, Avalonia also runs on Linux and does not rely on a Catalyst/WinUI indirection layer for desktop platforms, simplifying development and debugging.</p>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="ASP.NET Core" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="aspdotnet_core">
<h2>ASP.NET Core</h2>
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary=".ASP.NET Core" data-primary-sortas="ASPNET" data-type="indexterm" id="id2667"/>ASP.NET Core is a lightweight modular successor to ASP.NET and is suitable for creating web sites, REST-based web APIs, and microservices. It can also run in conjunction with two popular single-page-application frameworks: React and Angular.</p>
<p>ASP.NET supports the popular <em>Model-View-Controller</em> (MVC) pattern, as well as a newer technology called Blazor, where client-side code is written in C# instead of JavaScript.</p>
<p>ASP.NET Core runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS and can self-host in a custom process. Unlike its .NET Framework predecessor (ASP.NET), ASP.NET Core is not dependent on <code>System.Web</code> and the historical baggage of web forms.</p>
<p>As with any thin-client architecture, ASP.NET Core offers the following general advantages over rich clients:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There is zero deployment at the client end.</p></li>
<li><p>The client can run on any platform that supports a web browser.</p></li>
<li><p>Updates are easily deployed.</p></li>

<h2>Windows Desktop</h2>
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Windows Desktop application layer" data-type="indexterm" id="id2668"/>The Windows Desktop application layer offers a choice of two UI APIs for writing rich-client applications: WPF and Windows Forms. Both APIs run on Windows Desktop/Server 7 through 11.</p>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="WPF" data-type="sect3"><div class="sect3" id="wpf">
<h3>WPF</h3>
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)" data-type="indexterm" id="id2669"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)" data-type="indexterm" id="id2670"/>WPF was introduced in 2006, and has been enhanced ever since. Unlike its predecessor, Windows Forms, WPF explicitly renders controls using DirectX, with the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It supports sophisticated graphics, such as arbitrary transformations, 3D rendering, multimedia, and true transparency. Skinning is supported through styles and templates.</p></li>
<li><p>Its primary measurement unit is not pixel based, so applications display correctly at any DPI setting.</p></li>
<li><p>It has extensive and flexible layout support, which means that you can localize an application without danger of elements overlapping.</p></li>
<li><p>Its use of DirectX makes rendering fast and able to take advantage of graphics hardware acceleration.</p></li>
<li><p>It offers reliable data binding.</p></li>
<li><p>UIs can be described declaratively in XAML files that can be maintained independent of the “code-behind” files—this helps to separate appearance from functionality.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>WPF takes some time to learn due to its size and complexity. The types for writing WPF applications are in the <code>System.Windows</code> namespace and all subnamespaces except for <code>System.Windows.Forms</code>.</p>
</div></section>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Windows Forms" data-type="sect3"><div class="sect3" id="windows_forms">
<h3>Windows Forms</h3>
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Windows Forms" data-type="indexterm" id="id2671"/>Windows Forms is a rich-client API that shipped with the first version of .NET Framework in 2000. Compared to WPF, Windows Forms is a relatively simple technology that provides most of the features you need in writing a typical Windows application. It also has significant relevancy in maintaining legacy applications. But compared to WPF, it has numerous drawbacks, most of which stem from it being a wrapper over GDI+ and the Win32 control library:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Although Windows Forms provides mechanisms for DPI-awareness, it’s still too easy to write applications that break on clients whose DPI settings differ from the developer’s.</p></li>
<li><p>The API for drawing nonstandard controls is GDI+, which, although reasonably flexible, is slow in rendering large areas (and without double buffering, might flicker).</p></li>
<li><p>Controls lack true transparency.</p></li>
<li><p>Most controls are noncompositional. For instance, you can’t put an image control inside a tab control header. Customizing list views, combo boxes, and tab controls in a way that would be trivial with WPF is time consuming and painful in Windows Forms.</p></li>
<li><p>Dynamic layout is difficult to correctly implement reliably.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The last point is an excellent reason to favor WPF over Windows Forms—even if you’re writing a business application that needs just a UI and not a “user experience.” The layout elements in WPF, such as <code>Grid</code>, make it easy to assemble labels and text boxes such that they always align—even after language-changing localization—without messy logic and without any flickering. Further, you don’t need to bow to the lowest common denominator in screen resolution—WPF layout elements have been designed from the outset to adapt properly to resizing.</p>
<p>On the positive side, Windows Forms is relatively simple to learn and still has a good number of third-party controls.</p>
<p>The Windows Forms types are in the <code>System.Windows.Forms</code> (in <em>System.Windows.Forms.dll</em>) and <code>System.Drawing</code> (in <em>System.Drawing.dll</em>) namespaces. The latter also contains the GDI+ types for drawing custom controls.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="UWP and WinUI 3" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="uwp_and_winui_three">
<h2>UWP and WinUI 3</h2>
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="UWP (Universal Windows Platform)" data-type="indexterm" id="id2672"/>UWP is a rich-client API for writing touch-first UIs that target Windows 10+ desktop and devices. The word “Universal” refers to its ability to run on a range of Windows 10 devices, including Xbox, Surface Hub, HoloLens, and (at the time) Windows Phone.</p>
<p>The UWP API uses XAML and is somewhat similar to WPF. Here are its key differences:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The primary mode of distribution for UWP apps is the Windows Store.</p></li>
<li><p>UWP apps run in a sandbox to lessen the threat of malware, which means that they cannot perform tasks such as reading or writing arbitrary files, and they cannot run with administrative elevation.</p></li>
<li><p>UWP relies on WinRT types that are part of the operating system (Windows), not the managed runtime. This means that when writing apps, you must nominate a Windows <em>version range</em> (such as Windows 10 build 17763 to Windows 10 build 18362). This means that you either need to target an old API or require that your customers install the latest Windows update.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Because of the limitations created by these differences, UWP never succeeded in matching the popularity of WPF and Windows Forms. To address this, Microsoft has morphed UWP into a new technology called Windows App SDK (with a UI layer called WinUI 3).</p>
<p>The Windows App SDK transfers the WinRT APIs from the operating system to the runtime, thereby exposing a fully managed interface and removing the necessity to target a specific operating system version range. It also does the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Integrates better with the Windows Desktop APIs (Windows Forms and WPF)</p></li>
<li><p>Allows you to write applications that run outside the Windows Store sandbox</p></li>
<li><p>Runs atop the latest .NET (instead of being tied to .NET Core 2.2, as is the case with UWP)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Despite these improvements, WinUI 3 hasn’t gained the widespread popularity of the classic Windows Desktop APIs. Windows App SDK also does not support Xbox or HoloLens at the time of writing, and requires a separate end-user download.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="MAUI" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="maui-id00078">
<h2>MAUI</h2>
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="MAUI" data-type="indexterm" id="id2673"/>MAUI (formerly Xamarin) lets you develop mobile apps in C# that target iOS and Android (as well as cross-platform desktop apps that target macOS and Windows via Catalyst and Windows App SDK).</p>
<p>The CLR/BCL that runs on iOS and Android is called Mono (a derivation of the open-source Mono runtime). Historically, Mono hasn’t been fully compatible with .NET, and libraries that ran on both Mono and .NET would target .NET Standard. From .NET 6, however, Mono’s public interface merged with .NET, making Mono, in effect, an <em>implementation</em> of .NET.</p>
<p>MAUI includes a unified project interface, hot reloading, and support for Blazor Desktop and hybrid apps.
