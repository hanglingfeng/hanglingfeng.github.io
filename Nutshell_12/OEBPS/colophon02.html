<h1>Colophon</h1>

<p>The animal on the cover of <em>C# 12 in a Nutshell</em> is a numidian crane. The numidian crane (<em>Grus virgo</em>) is also called the demoiselle crane because of its grace and symmetry. This species of crane is native to Europe and Asia and migrates to India, Pakistan, and northeast Africa in the winter.</p>

<p>Though numidian cranes are the smallest cranes, they defend their territories as aggressively as other crane species, using their loud voices to warn others of trespassing. If necessary, they will fight. Numidian cranes nest in uplands rather than wetlands and will even live in the desert if there is water within 200 to 500 meters. They sometimes make nests out of pebbles in which to lay their eggs, though more often they will lay eggs directly on the ground, protected only by vegetation.</p>

<p>Numidian cranes are considered a symbol of good luck in some countries and are sometimes even protected by law. Many of the animals on O’Reilly covers are endangered; all of them are important to the world.</p>
