<h1>Preface</h1>
<p>C# 12 represents the ninth major update to Microsoft’s flagship programming language, positioning C# as a language with unusual flexibility and breadth. At one end, it offers high-level abstractions such as query expressions and asynchronous continuations, whereas at the other end, it allows low-level efficiency through constructs such as custom value types and optional pointers.</p>
<p>The price of this growth is that there’s more than ever to learn. Although tools such as Microsoft’s IntelliSense—and online references—are excellent in helping you on the job, they presume an existing map of conceptual knowledge. This book provides exactly that map of knowledge in a concise and unified style—free of clutter and long introductions.</p>
<p>Like the past seven editions, <em>C# 12 in a Nutshell</em> is organized around concepts and use cases, making it friendly both to sequential reading and to random browsing. It also plumbs significant depths while assuming only basic background knowledge, making it accessible to intermediate as well as advanced readers.</p>
<p>This book covers C#, the Common Language Runtime (CLR), and the .NET 8 Base Class Library (BCL). We’ve chosen this focus to allow space for difficult and advanced topics without compromising depth or readability. Features recently added to C# are flagged so that you can also use this book as a reference for C# 11 and C# 10.</p>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Intended Audience" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="intended_audience">
<h1>Intended Audience</h1>
<p>This book targets intermediate to advanced audiences. No prior knowledge of C# is required, but some general programming experience is necessary. For the beginner, this book complements, rather than replaces, a tutorial-style introduction to programming.</p>
<p class="pagebreak-before">This book is an ideal companion to any of the vast array of books that focus on an applied technology such as ASP.NET Core or Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). <em>C# 12 in a Nutshell</em> covers the areas of the language and .NET that such books omit, and vice versa.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a book that skims every .NET technology, this is not for you. This book is also unsuitable if you want to learn about APIs specific to mobile device development.</p>

<h1>How This Book Is Organized</h1>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#chash_language_basics">Chapter 2</a> through <a data-type="xref" href="ch04.html#advanced_chash">Chapter 4</a> concentrate purely on C#, starting with the basics of syntax, types, and variables, and finishing with advanced topics such as unsafe code and preprocessor directives. If you’re new to the language, you should read these chapters sequentially.</p>
<p>The remaining chapters focus on .NET 8’s Base Class Libraries, covering such topics as Language-Integrated Query (LINQ), XML, collections, concurrency, I/O and networking, memory management, reflection, dynamic programming, attributes, cryptography, and native interoperability. You can read most of these chapters randomly, except for Chapters <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch05.html#dotnet_overview">5</a> and <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch06.html#dotnet_fundamentals">6</a>, which lay a foundation for subsequent topics. You’re also best off reading the three chapters on LINQ in sequence, and some chapters assume some knowledge of concurrency, which we cover in <a data-type="xref" href="ch14.html#concurrency_and_asynchron">Chapter 14</a>.</p>

<h1>What You Need to Use This Book</h1>
<p>The examples in this book require .NET 8. You will also find Microsoft’s .NET documentation useful to look up individual types and members (which is available <a href="https://oreil.ly/y5bAc">online</a>).</p>
<p>Although it’s possible to write source code in a simple text editor and build your program from the command line, you’ll be much more productive with a <em>code scratchpad</em> for instantly testing code snippets, plus an <em>integrated development environment</em> (IDE) for producing executables and libraries.</p>
<p>For a Windows code scratchpad, download LINQPad 8 from <a href="http://www.linqpad.net"><em>www.linqpad.net</em></a> (free). LINQPad fully supports C# 12 and is maintained by the author.</p>
<p>For a Windows IDE, download <em>Visual Studio 2022</em>: any edition is suitable for what’s taught in this book. For a cross-platform IDE, download <em>Visual Studio Code</em>.</p>
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
<p>All code listings for all chapters are available as interactive (editable) LINQPad samples. You can download the entire lot in a single click: at the bottom left, click the LINQPad’s Samples tab, click “Download more samples,” and then choose “C# 12 in a Nutshell.”</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Conventions Used in This Book" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="conventions_used_in_this_book">
<h1>Conventions Used in This Book</h1>
<p>The book uses basic UML notation to illustrate relationships between types, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#sample_diagram">Figure P-1</a>. A slanted rectangle means an abstract class; a circle means an interface. A line with a hollow triangle denotes inheritance, with the triangle pointing to the base type. A line with an arrow denotes a one-way association; a line without an arrow denotes a two-way association.</p>
