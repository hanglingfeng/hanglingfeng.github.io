    <h1 id="_idParaDest-1" class="mainHeading">Foreword</h1>
    <p class="normal">In 2017, I met Jimmy at an event in Stockholm, where I quickly noticed his passion for technology, user experience, and pop culture. We spent the better part of an hour debating Marvel versus DC Comics characters and storylines, and I knew this was a person who studied for both his craft and hobbies. His presentations regarding Blazor, HoloLens, and delivering better applications for our users are always cutting edge and lead the audience to best practices for each technology.</p>
    <p class="normal">The author has been a Microsoft MVP and community leader for almost a decade. The Swedish developer community has grown under his leadership and benefitted from his insights to build better applications and services. The Blazm components library that he wrote and made available is a prime example of helping other developers in his local community and across the world.</p>
    <p class="normal">This book has been written for the practical Blazor developer. Clear definitions of why you need to consider each feature of the framework are followed by examples and clear solutions that will make you immediately successful. You’ll learn by following along with the very relatable example project of a blog engine. From user interface topics through API design and security considerations, the blog engine you will build with Blazor and ASP.NET Core in this book will run in production and can easily serve your blog. I appreciate that Jimmy introduces and covers bringing your Blazor application to .NET MAUI and building a native application for Windows, MacOS, iOS, and Android as part of the 18th chapter. Jimmy does a great job showing the portability and power of Blazor combined with MAUI and the native application capabilities of that framework. The final chapter of this book is an awesome reference for new and seasoned developers, with answers to the typical problems that will surface during the lifetime of your application, and it should be kept as a desktop reference for years to come.</p>

Jürgen writes for the dotnetPro Magazine, one of the most popular German speaking developer magazines. He also publishes articles in English on his blog on “ASP.NET Hacker” and contributes to several open-source projects. Jürgen has been a Microsoft MVP since 2015.</p>
    <p class="normal">For quite some years, Jürgen does technical reviews for books like this for Packt, and he also wrote a book called <em class="italic">Customizing ASP.NET Core</em> for ASP.NET Core 5 and ASP.NET Core 6.</p>
    <p class="normal">He works as a developer, consultant, and trainer for the digital agency YOO Inc. located in Basel (Switzerland). YOO Inc. serves national as well as international clients and specializes in creating custom digital solution for distinct business needs.</p>
    <p class="normal"><span class="FM-authorNameInBio">Jessica Engström</span> has been a Microsoft MVP for over 9 years. Her passion for the community can be seen in her activities like teaching, organizing, and speaking at conferences all over the world, running a podcast (Coding After Work), and streams (MarriedGeeks &amp; CodingAfterWork).</p>
    <p class="normal">Recently, she ventured into cybersecurity as a community manager at Detectify, working with ethical hackers.</p>
    <p class="normal">She spends too much money on Lego in her spare time and loves to drive her EV.</p>
    <p class="normal"><span class="FM-authorNameInBio">David Vanderheyden</span> is a husband, a father of two sons and a daughter, and is fluent and communicative with a big interest in innovative technologies. From his early childhood years, he was very curious about computers, how they are built, and how they work. </p>
    <p class="normal">Because of this curiousity, he taught himself the basics of web development and learned about operating systems, infrastructure, and programming. As a true auto-didact, he extended his knowledge of diverse programming languages, technical stacks, and architectures and patterns. On the sides he blogged in his spare time about things learned. After years of building websites and doing Desktop Publishing (DTP) work for non-profits, friends, and family, he changed his career to software development and he worked as a technical consultant on a wide range of projects, from migrating applications to creating new applications on the full stack. He spends his days as a freelance consultant focused on the.NET stack, helping businesses with their software needs and helping fellow developers with migrations to Blazor.</p>
    <p class="FM-acknowledgement">First and foremost, I would like to thank my wife and children for all the love and support in my endeavors. You guys frequently share me with my work, but you will always be my number one priority. A big thanks to Wouter and Packt for this opportunity, and thank you Jimmy and the people at Packt for this cooperation; it’s been a true delight.</p>
